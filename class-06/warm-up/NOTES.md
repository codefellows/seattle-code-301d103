# Overview of the warm-up challenge

Break students out into groups of 2 for 10 minutes. If class is smaller, break into groups of 3 - 4. After regrouping discuss how easy or difficult it was to use AI tooling to assist in componetization.  

Common outputs that may need additional prompts to shape results:

- Initial prompt may componentize into functional components rather than class components.
- Animal Component not keeping track of its own state for votes.
- Consider prompting to move the data into a seperate JSON file to mirror how we've handled data up to this point.
