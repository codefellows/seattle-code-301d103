# Project Name  
City-Explorer  
**Author**: Samaad Turner   
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)    

## Overview
Imagine you want directions of a city of your picking. This assignment will demonstrate an understanding of API's and how to render requests to the screen.   

## Getting Started
You can just follow my link to my nelify and it is an already published site.

## Architecture  
I used bootstrap to make cards. LocationIQ was used to fetch all information shown on screen.
## Change Log  

08-22-2023 1:15pm - Application now has a fully-functional site that gathers information on a city that a user inquires about.

## Credit and Collaborations  
Got help from a mixture of things including Jacob Knaack and ChatGPT
