## Overview

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations

### Logistical

What hours will you be available to communicate?

- 9:00am - 6:00pm
  What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
- Slack, Discord
  How often will you take breaks?
- Every hour (10 minute break)
  What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
- Ask for help, increase time of availability

### Cooperative

Make a list of each parson’s strengths.

- Kat - CSS (bootstrap)
- Josh - backend
  How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
- working on/utilizing tools associated with strength
  In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
- Utilizing databases
  Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
- Begin each session with a run down/ rubber duck of what is happening so far in the code, making it easier to see what needs to be done next.

### Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?

- Ask how you can better contribute to what that person is doing.
  What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
- Assign features to be completed by each team member so that one person can't just complete everything.
  How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- Communicating on what needs to be done, and having that daily break down of the code making sure that everyone understands what is happening.
