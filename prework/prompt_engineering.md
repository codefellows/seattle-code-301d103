# Prompt Engineering

Read through sections of the Prompt Engineering Guide starting with [Basics](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/basics) and continuing through [Examples](https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/examples).  Skim the [Generating Code](https://www.promptingguide.ai/applications/coding) section for anything you may find useful when generating code using ChatGPT.

Using ChatGPT, create a prompt or series of prompts that can produce the following code:

```javascript
function Store(name, minimumCustomers, maximumCustomers, avgCookiesPerCustomer) {
  this.name = name;
  this.minimumCustomers = minimumCustomers;
  this.maximumCustomers = maximumCustomers;
  this.avgCookiesPerCustomer = avgCookiesPerCustomer;
}
```

Stretch Goal:  Have ChatGPT convert this into an ES6 class and ask it to explain any changes that were made.

Submit the prompts used and the responses provided by ChatGPT.
